## Requirements

We have tested this code with the following configuration:

* Python 3.5.2
* Jupyter 4.3.0
* Tensorflow 1.2.1
* Keras 2.0.5

Update: Since some recent Keras update seems to have broken our code, here is a quick fix as to how to run with the old compatible Keras version.
using virtualenv (https://virtualenv.pypa.io).

```
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip3 nstall -vI keras==2.0.5
pip3 install jupyter matplotlib numpy tensorflow-gpu tqdm seaborn
```
